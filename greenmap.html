        <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p class="textcenter">For this project, we seeked to create collaborative social platform connecting everyday 
              Australians with sustainable organisations and points of interests to help promote 
              sustainable activities within neighbourhoods. As information on sustainable practices is 
              decentralised and often segregated on the different websites (through different 
              organisations/businesses/councils), the public is often left on their own to piece the
               information together. Our app aims to alleviate this issue by reducing the information 
               and time cost that is associated with researching information on sustainable practices 
               and planning how to achieve their sustainable goals. This will be achieved by creating a 
               centralised location for businesses, organisations and councils to come together and post 
               information on their sustainable activities and places where the public may utilise to 
               engage in sustainable activities.</p>

        <h2>Define</h2>
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p class="textcenter">Environmental sustainability is a global-issue whereby poor practices results in unfavourable 
          climate change that negatively impacts every living organism on the world. However, tackling 
          the issue of climate change is often complex and a greater scientific and societal understanding 
          of climate change is often the most effective method to address the problem. It is here that the 
          problem statement of the project stems; how might we improve accessibility of information on 
          environmentally sustainable practices so that we can decrease the ecological footprint of each
          individual?.<br><br></p>
        <h1>Product vision and solution</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Centralising information on where and how the public can participate in sustainable practice 
            to make it more convenient and accessible for people to take affirmative measures.
          </li>
          <li>Centralising information where people can easily find where they can participate in s
            ustainable actions as well as organisations which support sustainable practices so that 
            it will reduce the tedious activity in finding information from different sources.
          </li>
          <li>By creating a community of people and organisations which people can evaluate and share 
            their experience or encounters around sustainability, to increase motivation in people to 
            participate.</li>
          <li>By integrating social collaboration to assist in the expansion of information and data 
            around sustainable resources and increasing data reliability</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Thus, by implementing these solutions, our application will endeavour to increase the 
          likelihood of which an individual will participate in sustainable actions, thereby combating 
          the waste being generated and redirecting them to be reused or repurposed and supporting the 
          environment.</p>

      <h2>Development</h2>
        <h1>Technical Development</h1>
        <p>In terms of technical development of Greenmap, we used Node.js for our JavaScript runtime 
          environment. From here, the development process can be broken into two main phases, backend 
          and frontend. For the backend server we used an Express.js framework for its ease of use in
           implementing a REST API and straightforward code modularization. This server is hosted on 
           Heroku. All the data needed for the website can be generated by making calls to this backend, 
           ensuring that all the data modification is handled through the backend for increased privacy 
           and efficiency. All the data needed to store business, user, and review information is stored
            on MongoDB Atlas, which interfaces with the API calls through the mongoose.js library. 
            Mongoose is highly similar with the typical MongoDB query syntax, which made for painless 
            database calls. We used React to generate the frontend of our web application. As our website
             has a lot of similar sections, such as the lists of businesses on the map and user pages, 
             React made it easy to generate our frontend because it is largely component based. 
             Additionally, the state cycles and management of React was ideal for managing user input
              for various server requests such as login, register, search, and adding a new business. 
              Some other libraries used:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>bcrypt.js</li>
            <li>Google Maps</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>API</li>
          </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>Overall, development of GreenMap ran smoothly without significant problems considering 
          the challenge was imposed on us by the Covid-19 pandemic. It became clear early in development 
          that the set of functionalities initially proposed were ambitious. As we learned the 
          complexities of the task, we reassessed the more social elements of our application. 
          The proposal emphasised the idea of a ‘score’, that users could accrue by checking in to 
          sustainable businesses. We decided that the score was less relevant to the purpose of the 
          application, and instead focussed on making it simple to search for businesses near you, 
          based on relevant green criteria. Associated with this, we removed the planned coupon system, 
          which would have been earned by accruing sufficient points. The result of these changes was a 
          more focussed application, without additional complexity, that more effectively achieves its 
          goals. 
          <br>
          Developing GreenMap was an invaluable learning experience for the five of us to develop an 
          application that addresses a real-world challenge. We developed skills that will allow each 
          of us to work collaboratively in software development projects, both at university and 
          professionally. Better practices around codebase management, collaboration through version
           control systems, and deadline setting would have allowed us to complete the product earlier 
           and with less stress; however, we believe the outcome is of high quality, and effectively
            addresses the goal of making sustainability achievable.</p>
