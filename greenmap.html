        <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p class="textcenter">For this project, we sought to create a collaborative social platform connecting 
            everyday Australians with sustainable organisations and points of interests to help promote sustainable
             activities within neighbourhoods. As the information on sustainable practices is decentralised 
             and often segregated on different websites (through different organisations/businesses/councils), 
             the public is often left on their own to piece the information together. Our app aims to
              alleviate this issue by reducing the information and time cost that is associated with 
              researching information on sustainable practices and planning how to achieve their sustainable goals. 
              This was achieved by creating a centralised location for businesses, organisations and councils to
               come together and post information on their sustainable activities and places where the public may 
               utilise to engage in sustainable activities.</p>

        <h2>Define</h2>
           <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p class="textcenter">Environmental sustainability is a global issue whereby poor practices 
              result in unfavourable climate change that negatively impacts every living organism in the
               world. However, tackling the issue of climate change is often complex and a greater 
               scientific and societal understanding of climate change is often the most effective
                method to address the problem. It is here that the problem statement of the project stems; </p>
              <h4 class="textcenter">"How might we improve the accessibility of information on environmentally 
                sustainable practices so that we can decrease the ecological footprint of each individual?."<br><br></h4>
            <h1>Product vision</h1>
            <h3>The goals and aims for our application</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Centralising information on where and how the public can participate in sustainable practice 
                to make it more convenient and accessible for people to take affirmative measures.
              </li>
              <li>Centralising information where people can easily find where they can participate in 
                sustainable actions as well as organisations which support sustainable practices. 
                To will reduce the tedious activity in finding information from different sources.
              </li>
              <li>By creating a community of people and organisations which members of the public can evaluate and share 
                their experience or encounters around sustainability, to increase motivation in people to 
                participate.</li>
              <li>By integrating social collaboration to assist in the expansion of information and data 
                around sustainable resources and increasing data reliability</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>By implementing these solutions, our application will endeavour to increase the likelihood 
              of which an individual will participate in sustainable actions. Thereby, combating the
               waste generated and redirecting them to be reused or repurposed to support the 
               environment.</p>

      <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
      <h1>Technical Development Process</h1>
      <p class="textcenter">In terms of technical development of GreenMAP, we used Node.js for our JavaScript runtime 
        environment. From here, the development process can be broken into two main phases, backend and
         frontend. For the backend server we used an Express.js framework for its ease of use 
         in implementing a REST API and straightforward code modularization. This server is hosted on
          Heroku. All the data needed for the website can be generated by making calls to this backend, 
          ensuring that all the data modification is handled through the backend for increased privacy and 
          efficiency. All the data needed to store business, user, and review information is stored on 
          MongoDB Atlas, which interfaces with the API calls through the mongoose.js library. Mongoose 
          is highly similar with the typical MongoDB query syntax, which made for painless database calls. 
          We used React to generate the frontend of our web application. As our website has a lot of 
          similar sections, such as the lists of businesses on the map and user pages, React made it
           easy to generate our frontend because it is largely component based. Additionally, 
           the state cycles and management of React was ideal for managing user input for various server
            requests such as login, register, search, and adding a new business.</p>

      <h2>Reflection and takeaways</h2>
        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p class="textcenter">Overall, development of GreenMAP ran smoothly without significant problems considering 
          the challenges imposed on us by the Covid-19 pandemic. Developing GreenMAP was an invaluable 
          learning experience for the five of us to develop an application that addresses a real-world 
          challenge. We developed skills that will allow each of us to work collaboratively in software 
          development projects, both at university and professionally.</p>

          <p>If there was more time</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do more indepths research of problem with stakeholders</li>
            <li>Do further iterations / testings, to further improve user expernece</li>
          </ul> 
          <br><br>
      <h1>Takeaways</h1>
      <p>What I have learned from this project?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>How to create backend and use REACT</b>
          <br>I was able to learn how the backend of a website operates using node.js as well as how to develop a REACT front-end.</li>
           <li><b>Collaboration with developers</b>
            <br>In this project, I learnt that collaboration and good teamwork with developers 
            is key to smooth and easy development process. </li>
