              <p>Perspective 1</p>
              <p class="mini2">This perspective portrays the city the day of “when Eutropia`s 
                inhabitants feel the grip of weariness and no one can bear any longer his job,
                his relative his house and his life” before “the whole citizenry decides to
                move to the next city, which is waiting for them”. In my interpretation I 
                imagined that this time the environment of the city of people being very dark,
                thereby I showcased the perspective to be dark with a stormy weather
                symbolizing the mood. I also depicted the people in the image to look unhappy, 
                distressed and or in rage, to show why no one can bear to stay in this city.<br><br></p>
              <p>Perspective 2</p> 
              <p class="mini2"> This perspective portrays the city after the citizens of when 
                Eutropia move to the next city “which is there waiting for them, empty and good
                as new” where “each will take up a new job, a different wife, will see another 
                landscape on opening his windows, and will spend time with different pastimes, 
                friends, gossip.” Here I wanted to portray my image with a lighter tone as to 
                depict a new clean shining city as well as the people’s mood in the city becoming 
                lighter juxtaposing from Perspective 1. I wanted to depict the people to be happy 
                with their new job, new wife and new friends. I also made the view seen from the 
                quadrangle to be much different from perspective 1 to show that it is a completely 
                new city with different landscape<br><br></p>
