        <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p class="textcenter">This is a design project I executed as a part of my studies at university. 
               In this project, I was asked to pick an e-commerce site in our allocated field 
               and redesign its user interface for both desktop and mobile versions. 
               As my allocated field was vinyl’s and CD’s the ecommerce site I chose was Red 
               Eye Records. Red Eye Records is Sydney’s largest independent music retailer 
               with a fast-growing e-commerce platform with customers from all over the world 
               seeking their rare, out of print and unique Australian vinyl’s and CD’s.</p>

            <p>The Business Page is a way for visitors to learn more about each POI once navigated

              However, some features are only available to users who are registered and logged in.

              <p>The user profile page is an area where users can access their favourites and check-in. 
                This provides an easy and efficient way for users to visit listings they have previously 
                bookmarked or visited. Users may also update their account details on this page. Users are
                 also able to visit other user profiles by sharing their profile URL or via clicking on

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <h1>What I have learnt</h1>
        <p class="textcenter" >This project pushed me in term of learning how to use UI prototyping software (Adobe XD) and new coding skills(HTML/CSS/JavaScript) in a short period. 

          Although I believe my redesign is an improvement from the previous site, because the focus was on learning these new skills, time to research for user experience and improve the graphic design was left as a secondary priority. I believe if more time were provided, these key elements would have enhanced, creating a higher quality site.
          
          That being said, the project has plenty of aspects I am happy with. At the beginning of this project, I had barely used Adobe XD before; however, at the end of this project, I could confidently say I could operate the program comfortability. This was a significant catalyst in further improving my skills in the program, which I believe is now at a high level. Additionally, learning basic HTML CSS and JavaScript helped me understand more about how frontend development operates and is created.
          
          Although there are improvements to be made to this redesign, this project helped me gain new skills and a clearer insight on user interface development. <br>  <br>  </p>
