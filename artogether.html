        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p class="textcenter">The challenge of facilitating creative arts therapy online has recently become more prevalent with the Covid-19 pandemic forcing many therapists and patients to resort to online video conferencing to continue their practise. ARTogether takes this challenge as a unique opportunity to explore the potential of novel and empathetic interactive system design as a solution to this problem, both in times where social distancing is required and for long term application in general remote therapy.</p>

          <p class="textcenter">To gain insight into users needs and issues, eight semi-structured 
            exploratory interviews across 5 creative arts threapist were conducted 
            on zoom.</p>
          <h3>Interviewees</h3>

          <h3>Key Findings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Limitations of digital therapy in creating strong interpersonal 
              relationships not only between the therapist and patient but also 
              patient to patient during group sessions.</li><br>
            <li>Issues in materiality and physicality alongside space restrictions 
              of holding therapy sessions digitally.  </li><br>
            <li>Requirements for structure, but also being able to cater to and 
              change sessions as necessary before and during is also prevalent 
              as the therapy practice is explained consistently to center around

        <h2>01. Rich Picture</h2>
        <p class="textcenter"> To help us identify the complexity of our entire problem statement, 
          a rich picture was created based on insights we gain through the interviewing 
          process.</p>

        <h2>01. Exploring solutions</h2>
        <p class="textcenter">The previous processes made it evident that there are many issues we 
          can address surrounding digital art therapy which we could address with our 
          design. Thus we decided to brainstorm ideas by each of us coming up with a 
          design solution which addressed the problem in different ways.</p>
        <img class="wideimg" src="./images/outside.png">
        <p>Through collective critiquing of all design ideas, the concluded direction 
          for the next stage of development will focus on the facilitation of therapy 
          sessions. Instead of selecting and expanding off of one member’s idea, design
           features in the three ideas revolving session facilitation – ‘Mood Room’, 
           ‘Up Up and Away’, and ‘Digital Therapy Space’ – will be amalgamated. 
           The combined prototype will include features of patient mood visualisation, 
           pre-session planning for the therapist, and overall separate views for the 
           therapist and patient inside and outside sessions. Pre-session planning for 
           the therapist will have an intuitive interface based upon a session timeline 
           and settings that will then be translated into automated inclusions 
           (i.e. music, background, visuals, layouts) and smooth transitions between 
           the activities during a session.</p>

        <h1>User testing</h1>
        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <p>Usability evaluation of the main prototype was carried out with two user groups: 
          5 creative arts therapists and 2 therapy patients. The therapist group consisted 
          of practising creative arts therapists across disciplines of drama, dance, music 
          and visual art. For the patient group, there was a difficulty in sourcing genuine creative 
          arts therapy patients due to the niche and private nature of these target users. 
          Despite this, we endeavoured to source some representatives using creative convenience 
          sampling, thus we recruitment of two participants currently attending remote talk 
          therapy with interest and knowledge of creative arts therapy, despite having 
          not participated directly.

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>Due to persisting global circumstances, tests were conducted remotely via Zoom. 
          Participants interacted with an XD prototype through controlling the facilitators shared screen. 
          Limitations of this method, specifically that the interaction mode was with mouse on desktop not 
          touch screen on mobile as intended, is noted. Despite this, the remote method allowed efficient 
          evaluation and clear recording of the path participants took in each task despite being restricted
           to a remote environment. 
           <br>
          Each evaluation was conducted following these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Introduction and Pretest Arrangements</b> <br> Including signing of the study consent form and 
              gathering basic profile information of each participant. </li>
          <li><b>Pre-Session Tasks</b> <br> 5 for Therapists, and 4 for Patients. Tasks focused on the pre-session 
            scheduling and planning section of the prototype for both user groups as this aspect of the 
            prototype was feasibly able to be presented in an XD prototype.Task order was randomised to 
            minimise between-task learning that would unfairly represent the task ease.</li>
          <li><b>In-Session Demonstration Video</b> <br> Participants were shown an animated video of how the 
            scheduling and planning aspect of the prototype would be reflected in a live session. 
            This technique was chosen as it was valuable to gather thoughts on this major component of the 
            design but it was not possible to develop some complex interactive Wizard-of-Oz style prototype 
            of the live session component for remote testing in time. </li>
          <li><b>Post-Test Debrief and System Usability Scale (SUS) Survey</b> <br> An unstructured interview 
            was conducted at the conclusion of tasks and demonstration video to afford flexibility 
            to the facilitators to follow-up on things that stood out to them most. After this, 
            participants completed a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <img class="shadow" src="./images/results.png">
        <p>The average SUS score sits very high at 90 for both participant groups, above 80.3% percentile 
          threshold for an “A grade” (Sauro, 2011). Task averages are similarly at an attractive score of  
          less than 2 on our improvised scale of difficulty, 1 being the easiest and 5 being the most 
          difficult task, suggesting that patient groups found the app broadly usable and pleasant to 
          engage with.
        </p>
        <h1>Other findings</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Negligence towards the visibility of system status when scheduling. The design should have given 
            users appropriate feedback within a reasonable time to inform them on the effects of the
            actions taken.</li>
          <li>Lacked flexibility and efficiency. Our design didnt have many accelerators and shortcuts, 
            may often speed up the interaction process as well as provided flexibility to more seasoned or
             expert users </li>

        <h2>Reflection and takeaways</h2>
        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>Ultimately the design came together well but not without hardships. The pandemic meant 
          that as a team we could not attend therapy sessions on our own to gain first-hand experience. 
          It also, as mentioned, made conducting prototype evaluations more complicated and nuanced to 
          organise and prepare. However, these obstacles were overcome because of the amazing teamwork 
          and spirit given by all members of the group. Everyone was willing to put in the time and effort 
          required to make the project a success and supported each other along the way. In the time of 
          Coronavirus, sympathy and understanding were key to the cohesiveness of the group, and these are 
          skills everyone exhibited and in turn made a fruitful project that much more rewarding.</p>
        <p>Refectinng on what we have developed, although the concept of ARTogether was created within the creative arts therapy paradox, our 
          design may have, created new possibilities and approaches for facilitating video conferencing, 
          benefiting stakeholders beyond creative arts therapy. By designing for an edge case (in our 
          case, creative arts therapy) this transpires into a scalable solution. Thereby, the new ideas 
          and design solutions we created for this design concept may apply to more themes than the 
          current situation of use and design concept. Thus, it can apply in various other real-world
           problems and push solutions surrounding remote collaboration and video conferencing technology.

        <h1>What I have learned from this project?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Teamwork makes the dream work</b>
              <br>Although group work was challenging with the resections caused by COVID-19, 
              however this hardship lead me to learn the importance of collaboration. In this group 
              everyone was willing put in the hard work to make this project successful even at times 
              it was challenging.  It was inspiring to see how each person was able to bring to the table,
               different perspective of how we can tackle each issue throughout the process. Which I believe 
               to be the credit of the successful project.  </li>
            <li><b>Importance of user reaseach</b>
              <br>The research and especially the interviews really help us grab a better understanding of what we
               are designing and expanded our knowledge around creative arts therapy. Which help us solve real 
               problems and not assumptions.</li>
            <li><b>Big challenges require small steps</b>
              <br>I realised through this project that big challenges, cannot be solved instantly and the best way 
              to tackle them is to take small steps. Tackling small challenges within 
              the big challenges one by one.</li>
